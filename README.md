# Coluna/VRPSolver

This is an experimental code to integrate the [VRPSolver](https://vrpsolver.math.u-bordeaux.fr) and [Coluna](https://github.com/atoptima/Coluna.jl).
A preliminary working version on branch `using_bapcod` uses Coluna only as a Julia interface to VRPSolver with [BaPCod](https://bapcod.math.u-bordeaux.fr).
The version that bypasses BaPCod still has important performance issues.
